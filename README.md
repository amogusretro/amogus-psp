# Among Us! PSP edition

A fanmade, well-made PSP edition of the Among Us game. It is written in Rust


## How to build it?


To build the project, you need to have Rust(the nightly toolchain) installed.

Then install cargo-psp (Here you need to install the latest version of the nightly toolchain). Now you can run

```bash
    cargo psp
```


## Current Status

The project is now on dev, soon I will post it on my itch.io
