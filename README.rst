Among Us! PSP edition
======================

A fanmade, well-made PSP edition of the Among Us game. It is written in Rust


How to build it?
-----------------

To build the project, you need to have Rust installed.

Take caution: You must have Rust(nightly toolchain) version <= 2024-05-03 else it will makes errors

Then install cargo-psp (Here you need to install the latest version of the nightly toolchain). Now you can run

.. code-block:: bash
    
    #Here I will use nightly toolchain, v. 2024-05-03
    cargo +nightly-2024-05-03 psp
